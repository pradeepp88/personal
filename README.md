Hi, I'm Pradeep, a passionate Blockchain developer and a R&D engineer from Toronto. My passion for innovation led me to learn Blockchain and I forked my career into Blockchain Development through a course at George Brown College, Toronto. 

I work in a decentralized oracle for the Cardano blockchain called Charli3. I am also an active volunteer at PMI-Toronto, where I lead the GSuite team. Prior to this, I worked on building an innovative DeFi protocol - opty.fi. I was also volunteering with Bitcoin Bay maintaining their OPTN wallet. I also find the time to explore new and exciting stuff and participate in interesting Hackathons.

Prior to this fork, I was an avid and accomplished researcher in the field of Smart Manufacturing. I have a PhD from Nanyang Technological University, Singapore and have worked with Rolls-Royce - Singapore, Schlumberger - Abu Dhabi and IIT-Madras, India
