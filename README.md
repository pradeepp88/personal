Hi, I'm Pradeep, an innovative Blockchain architect from Toronto. My interest in decentralization, web3 and innovation led me to fork my career into Blockchain through a course at George Brown College, Toronto. I am currently working on an enterprise decentralized identity project at CGI. Prior to this, I have worked in decentralized projects like Charli3, an oracle for the Cardano blockchain, Optyfi, a DeFi yield aggregator on Ethereum and Bitcoin Bay's OPTN wallet for Bitcoin Cash. When I am free, I find the time to explore new and exciting stuff and participate in interesting Hackathons.

Prior to this fork, I was an avid and accomplished researcher in the field of Smart Manufacturing. I have a PhD from Nanyang Technological University, Singapore and have worked with Rolls-Royce - Singapore, Schlumberger - Abu Dhabi and IIT-Madras, India.
  
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything, I am happy to help;
